### Non-compliance with 4NF

The original data set was not compliant with 4NF due to the presence of multi-valued dependencies. Specifically:

- The `professor` and `professor_email` fields are dependent on each other but not on the primary key (composite key of `assignment_id`, `student_id`, and `due_date`).
- The `assignment_topic` and `relevant_reading` are dependent on `assignment_id` but not on the whole primary key.
- Classrooms are tied to specific courses and professors, suggesting an improper storage of multi-valued facts.

## Changes Made for 4NF Compliance

To achieve 4NF compliance, we restructured the data into multiple tables, each focusing on a single theme. This involved the creation of additional fields and tables, as necessary, to eliminate multi-valued dependencies. Below are the redesigned tables:

## Achieving 4NF Compliance

To make the dataset 4NF compliant, we undertook the following steps, creating separate tables for different entities to eliminate multi-valued and transitive dependencies:

### 1. Professors Table

This table eliminates redundancy and multi-valued dependencies related to professors' information.

| professor_id | professor_name | professor_email      |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1            | Melvin         | l.melvin@foo.edu     |
| 2            | Logston        | e.logston@foo.edu    |
| 3            | Nevarez        | i.nevarez@foo.edu    |

### 2. Assignments Table

Isolates assignments to eliminate redundancy in assignment topics and readings.

| assignment_id | assignment_topic                 | relevant_reading    |
|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1             | Data normalization               | Deumlich Chapter 3  |
| 2             | Single table queries             | Dümmlers Chapter 11 |
| 5             | Python and pandas                | Dümmlers Chapter 14 |
| 4             | Spreadsheet aggregate functions  | Zehnder Page 87     |

### 3. Courses Table

Added to provide a clear structure for course-related information, which was implicit in the original dataset.

| course_id | course_name    |
|-----------|----------------|
| 101       | Data Science   |
| 102       | Database Systems |

### 4. Classrooms Table

Organizes classroom information to manage physical locations independently of the courses or sections.

| classroom_id | classroom_location |
|--------------|--------------------|
| 1            | WWH 101            |
| 2            | 60FA 314           |
| 3            | WWH 201            |

### 5. Sections Table

Connects courses, professors, and classrooms, addressing the issue of sections of the same course possibly meeting in different classrooms or being taught by different professors.

| section_id | course_id | professor_id | classroom_id |
|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| 1          | 101       | 1            | 1            |
| 2          | 102       | 2            | 2            |
| 3          | 102       | 3            | 3            |

### 6. Grades Table

Stores grades, linking them to students, assignments, and the sections where the assignment was given, eliminating the multi-valued dependencies seen in the original dataset.

| student_id | section_id | assignment_id | grade | due_date  |
|------------|------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| 1          | 1          | 1             | 80    | 23.02.21  |
| 7          | 2          | 2             | 25    | 18.11.21  |
| 4          | 1          | 1             | 75    | 23.02.21  |
| 2          | 2          | 5             | 92    | 05.05.21  |
| 2          | 3          | 4             | 65    | 04.07.21  |
